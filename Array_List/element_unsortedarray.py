# Given an array of n distinct integers and an element x. Search the element x in the array using minimum
# number of comparisons. Any sort of comparison will contribute 1 to the count of comparisons. For
# example, the condition used to terminate a loop, will also contribute 1 to the count of comparisons each
# time it gets executed. Expressions like while (n) {nâ€“;} also contribute to the count of comparisons as
# value of n is being compared internally so as to decide whether or not to terminate the loop
